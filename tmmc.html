        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>This nonprofit organization protects marine mammal and ocean life across the West Coast. During our stakeholder interviews and preliminary user testing, we found that it was difficult to access important links like donations, volunteering, and adopt-a-seal. 
            Our solution was to create a more cohesive information hierarchy, reorganize the content, and highlight the key features.</p>

            <p class="textcenter">We conducted 6 user interviews and 20 surveys. We found that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Value transparency when looking for an organization to volunteer with (where’s the money going?)</li>
                <li>Look for organizations that have clear expectations  regarding volunteering</li>
                <li>Cluttered websites deter them from looking into more about the organization</li>
                <li>Drawn to social issues that they can empathize with</li>
                <li>Word-of-mouth as an effective mode of sharing volunteer opportunities</li>
            </ul>

                <p>We found that the overall feel of the website felt a bit dated. For example, icons, colors, and formatting were inconsistent throughout  pages. 
                    The search bar was hidden within the navigation, instead of formatted in an easily accessible/identifiable area.</p>

              <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
              <p>The ocean has been in trouble for a long time -- almost to a point of irreversible damage. In order to rehabilitate and restore the marine life in the West Coast, the Marine Mammal Center is seeking donations, volunteers, and public engagement. <br>How might we redesign the TMMC website so that users are able to easily find and learn more about ways to help, as well as commit to volunteering and donating?</p>

              <h3>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
              <p>One of the major changes we included in our lo-fidelity prototype was to update the navigation with the reiterated sitemap. In our user tests, we found that the sidebar navigation and the top navigation were both redundant. To make the pages feel less cluttered, we kept a more refined global navigation and removed the side navigation.</p>

              <p>Users noted that because the original navigation did not have a dropdown icon, it was unclear which menu items nested more links. Thus, we added an icon, that, when hovered, displays the secondary navigation. Because Adopt-a-Seal is an important program that the Marine Mammal Center relies on, we had to redesign the navigation so it stood out more compared to the rest of the navigation. The search bar is also now easier to identify than the original navigation.<br><br>Users noted that because the original navigation did not have a dropdown icon, it was unclear which menu items nested more links.

We shortened our header so that the content stood out. We also added a soft gradient too match the “ocean-like” feel that the organization sought for their website redesign. Furthermore, the most important functions, such as donate and adopt a seal stand out.</p>

              <p>It was a great opportunity working with stakeholders to produce a product that would benefit the Marine Mammal Center and support their missions.<br><br>
                Moving forward, it would be great to highlight other TMMC focuses, like their learning & education programs that they offer to aspiring vets around the world. Because the Marine Mammal Centers offers a variety of programs, ways to help, and more, we would love to see a more cohesive information architecture. <br>
                In future prototypes, it would be great to showcase other TMMC features such as their email newsletters, forums, and school programs.</p>
